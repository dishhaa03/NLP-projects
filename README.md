**NLP project reprository**

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project repository! In this repository, I have added two exciting NLP projects, each showcasing unique aspects of text analysis and classification..

**1. 📚 Naive Bayes Implementation from Scratch**

Description
In this project, I've implemented a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch. The Naive Bayes algorithm is a fundamental tool in text classification and sentiment analysis. By building this classifier from the ground up, I have gained a deep understanding of its inner workings. This project serves as a great learning resource for those interested in NLP and machine learning algorithms.

**2. 📰 Word and Document Vectors using Newsgroup Dataset**

Description
Explore the power of word and document vectors with my project on the Newsgroup dataset. I have employed state-of-the-art techniques to generate word embeddings and document vectors from this diverse text dataset. These vectors can be invaluable for tasks such as text similarity, topic modeling, and content recommendation. This project provides a practical demonstration of how to work with word and document vectors to extract meaningful insights from text data.


**Happy coding! 📊📝🔍🌐**
